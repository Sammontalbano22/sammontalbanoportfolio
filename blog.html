      <h2>Lessons from My First Hackathon</h2>

      <p>Participating in my first hackathon was thrilling and exhausting. Our team had 24 hours to build a prototype using open weather APIs. We ran into bugs, learned to work under pressure, and pitched our solution in front of judges. That weekend taught me more than weeks of coursework—and showed me I belonged in tech.</p>

      <h2>Why I Switched My Major to Computer Science</h2>

      <p>Initially, I thought I would be a psychology major. But I realized what I loved most was solving logic puzzles and building systems. One intro to Python course changed my trajectory. Switching to Computer Science gave me purpose, challenge, and the creative outlet I never knew I needed.</p>

      <h2>How I Built a Daily Goal Tracker App</h2>

      </div>
      <p>Inspired by my sticky note experience, I developed a daily goal tracker app using React and Firebase. Users can set long-term goals, check in daily, and reflect on their journey. I'm adding a virtual coach next to help people stay on track. It's my way of making persistence easier for everyone.</p>
